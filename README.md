## Description 

You might want to add the related articles **at top or bottom** of the article text and this is really simple and can be done with Injector Related. But, what about a decent placement in the middle of the article?

Well, the **Injector Related** plugin, counts the **HTML tags** for paragraphs _(`<p>...</p>`)_ OR divisions _(`<div>...</div>`)_ within the article text and can automatically place the list at the center of such tags.

Do you want to place the related articles one (_or up to 10_) tags above the end or below the start of the article? No problem! Injector Related will do the job.

You can too set which categories will the joomla's related articles will be placed automatically.

**No keywords?** Usually related content articles are picked by keywords, so if you have not set this for a large amount of articles, then you should have an alternate way to get more articles. So, Injector Related, can be configured to get articles with the same tags or from the same category or written by the same author.

Since maybe you want to hide or show manually the related content articles, Injector Related offers too an inline plugin syntax that can be included in each content article and will be parsed by this Joomla plugin to override the global configuration of the plugin.

## Documentation

Although I tried to keep the plugin really simple to operate, it gets complicated at the override configuration process, so I will try to keep the documentation up to date with the current version.

Since English is not my mother language, I could make unvoluntary mistakes. If you found some, please report it as stated in the [Support](#support) section.

Please notice that documentation is in HTML so you can use it even out of GitHub.
